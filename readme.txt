Funder Core Functions is a Visual Studio Solution with all the code neccisary to publish the Funder Core API. This API gives the front end the ability to pull data from, submit new data to, or edit existing records of the Postgres database. This solution also includes the code to retrieve the Secrets from my Azure KeyVault instances. 

This project is impossible to run outside of my own publishing profile due to not being authroized to access the Azure KeyVault instance outside of my own user ID attached to my Azure Account. I am able to demonstrate deploying of this code if need be.

The solution can be opened and viewed in Visual Studio 2017 or opening of the C# files underneath the solution is supported by almost any text editor.
